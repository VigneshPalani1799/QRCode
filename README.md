# QRCode

## Description
This masterâ€™s project aims to develop a mobile application prototype that facilitates reading for visually impaired individuals through auditory means. The suggested approach is transforming text into barcodes that resemble QR codes, resulting in a book made entirely of these barcodes. The book's content may be accessed by visually challenged readers by using their smartphones to scan each barcode that resembles a QR code on every page.
